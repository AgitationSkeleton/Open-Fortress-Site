    <h1>Kill 'Em Dead</h1>
    <p>Open Fortress is a free and open-source passion project, lovingly crafted by nearly a hundred members of the Team Fortress community with an ideal of fun gameplay as well as maximum customizability.</p>

    <h2>Meet The Merc</h2>
    <p>A smooth talker, hard hitter and a hell of a fast shooter, the Mercenary is a man raised by television and nurtured by film. Moulded by the dashing gunslingers and suave secret agents of the silver screen, he aspired to be just like them, even from a young age, when he went fist-to-fist with the orphanage's worst bullies and came out on top.</p>
    <p>With an arsenal jam-packed with the finest experimental prototype weapons blood-sport can buy, he's ready to show the world that he really is that twelve on the one-to-ten scale of badass.</p>
