question = "Are any of the assets or code shared with other mods like Team Deathmatch Classic or Team Fortress 2 Classic?"
answer = """The code features certain snippets of Open Source code on the valve developer wiki or openly avalible repos. While the art assets are mainly original, we got permission for certain models and textures like the Tommy Gun and the Landfall asset pack.
While the Mercenary concept took inspiration from Blaholtzen's concept it was, alongside the model, made entirely by @DrPyspy and Blaholtzen gave us the Thumbs Up. Everything inside the mod is either original or used with permission. Be sure to check out the Special thanks in our credits to see every asset we used.
There is some amazing stuff there! Be sure to check out the creators!"""
