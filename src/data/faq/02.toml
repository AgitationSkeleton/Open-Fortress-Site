question = "Will this mod only be focusing on Deathmatch?"
answer = """No. We are currently making great progress on completing the Deathmatch gamemode so that we can get to experimenting with new ideas afterward.
We have a lot of ideas going around and we would love to share all of them but if we work on a lot of gamemodes at once its hard to manage the workflow and usually results in a slower development time."""
